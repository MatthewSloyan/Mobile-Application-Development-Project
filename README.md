To Do List (UWP Application)
Overall, I have designed and developed an easy to use and functional To-Do List application. It follows a simple and minimal design with custom designed icons, logos and graphics. There is four pages which are listed below along with their functionalities. Also below that is how to use all the functionality and features.

- Page 1 - Personal list page for your most important to do list items. It allows you to add and delete basic text based list items.
- Page 2 - Shopping list page which allows the user to add a shopping list item along with the cost, the cost is then totalled as new items are added. There is validation for only adding only numbers in the cost section too.
- Page 3 - Weekly lists which allow the user to add text based list items and select the colour of that said list.
- Page 4 – Settings which allows the user to change the currency displayed on the shopping list page to Euro, British Pounds or Dollars. It also allows you to turn the sound for the delete list item buttons to ON/OFF.

How to use:

Personal List Page:

Shopping List Page:
